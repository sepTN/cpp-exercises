# EXERCISE 10

Write a program that is able to compute some operations on an integer. The program writes the value of the integer and writes the following menu :

1. Add 1
2. Multiply by 2
3. Subtract 4
4. Quit

The programs ask the user to type a value between 1 and 4. If the user types a value from 1 to 3 the operation is computed, the integer is written and the menu is displayed again. If the user types 4, the program quits.
